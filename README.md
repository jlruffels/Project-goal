# Project-goal
Phase 1 Project



# Welcome to my first project at Flatiron School. 

This application is designed for the User to set a goal depending on their exercise preference. 
Options include the treadmill, elliptical, or rowing machine.
Users may enter their desired goal and their end result. 
If end result reaches the goal, then the User will receieve a message, "Congratulations! Your goal has been achieved!" 
If end result doesn't reach the goal, then the User will instead receieve a message, "Try again tomorrow!"
